# Global Rules - LocalMind Development

## Core Philosophy
- **Privacy-first design** - "AI for those who can't afford to leak data"
- **Local-only processing** - No data leaves the user's machine
- **Professional security** - Suitable for confidential, sensitive information
- **Documents as teachers** - Compression over retrieval paradigm

## Privacy & Security Principles
- **Zero external connections** - No cloud dependencies during operation
- **Data encryption** - Secure storage of compressed memories
- **Audit readiness** - Suitable for legal, medical, research compliance
- **Offline capability** - Full functionality without internet access
- **Minimal attack surface** - Reduced dependencies and complexity

## Target User Considerations
- **Students** - Academic research, thesis work, study materials
- **Lawyers** - Case files, legal documents, client confidentiality
- **Researchers** - Literature review, interview transcripts, lab notes
- **Journalists** - Source protection, investigation materials

## Architecture Principles
- **Bounded memory** - 500KB limit with auto-cleanup for predictability
- **Clean separation** - Compressor, Manager, UI layers with proper isolation
- **Thread safety** - Background operations don't block UI or compromise security
- **Graceful degradation** - Never crash, comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Resource cleanup** - Proper disposal to prevent data leakage

## Code Standards
- **Security-first** - Validate all inputs, sanitize file operations
- **Error handling** - Try/catch with logging, never expose sensitive data
- **Type hints** - Use dataclasses and typing annotations for clarity
- **Documentation** - Clear docstrings explaining security implications
- **Performance** - Bounded operations, predictable resource usage

## UI/UX Guidelines
- **Privacy indicators** - Clear visual confirmation of local-only operation
- **Simple workflow** - Load model → Import docs → Chat (minimize complexity)
- **No document selection** - All memories always available for convenience
- **Professional design** - Dark theme, clean interface suitable for work environments
- **Accessibility** - Clear labels and keyboard navigation for all users

## Security Requirements
- **No telemetry** - No usage tracking or analytics
- **Local storage only** - All data remains on user's machine
- **Secure deletion** - Proper cleanup when documents are forgotten
- **Memory protection** - Clear sensitive data from RAM when possible
- **Audit logging** - Track document access for compliance needs
